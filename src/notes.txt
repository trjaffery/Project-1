professor advice:
arrival time is when computer b receives the package
the important thing is to keep track of when the package comes out
implement an event queue - future event list
list type structure - ordering needs to be preserved
the one you pull out first has to be the one with the least arrival time
make sure the queue supports event cancellation
if packets get lost you remove it from the queue

timers
suppose you want to simulate the sending of packets between comp a and b every few seconds
in real time of network, you would set a hardware Timer that would call a callback sensor every few mins
there is nothing in between events
Timer start- shove event into the list
when it reaches the Timer ends
